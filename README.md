# pug - puzzles on a grid

Suggs is for Madness, as dogs are to pugs

And all dogs love - puzzles on a grid


## Live Demo

*High-spec or GPU based machine advisable for better experience*

*The first time pug is run, pug will embed a Llama-3.1-8B model in the browser. This is a substantial download so will take a while*

Subsequent runs will use the cached LLM and so load much faster (~10-15 seconds).
